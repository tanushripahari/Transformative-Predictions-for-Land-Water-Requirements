# Transformative-Predictions-for-Land-Water-Requirements

Introduction:
The Penman-Monteith equation is a widely used method for estimating evapotranspiration rates, which are essential for various applications such as water resource management and agricultural planning. However, the standard Penman-Monteith equation does not account for the influence of CO2 concentration on evapotranspiration. In this study, I propose a modified equation that incorporates CO2 concentration as a variable, providing more accurate estimations of future evapotranspiration rates. Used a modified version of the Penman Monteith Equation, and future climate projection over India to examine the relationship btw atm co2 and reference evapotranspiration and developed a comprehensive model of how rising CO2 concentrations impact on land water requirement.

Methods:
To calculate evapotranspiration rates, I utilized xlsx files containing relevant climate data. I developed a Python code that incorporated functions from the pyeto package, as well as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries.The code employed the modified Penman-Monteith equation, which considered CO2 concentration, along with other variables such as net radiation, temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure. I also included options to adjust parameters related to stomatal conductance and CO2 concentration. The code extracted the required data from the xlsx files and performed the necessary calculations to estimate evapotranspiration rates.

Results:
By plotting evapotranspiration rate against CO2 concentration, I observed a clear relationship between the two variables. The graphs provided insights into how evapotranspiration rates respond to changes in CO2 concentration, allowing for more accurate estimations and predictions. The results of this study have implications for agricultural water management, particularly in the context of climate change. With rising CO2 concentrations, these modified equation provides more accurate estimations of future evapotranspiration rates, enabling better planning and allocation of water resources for crop irrigation. This information is vital for ensuring sustainable agricultural practices in the face of changing environmental conditions.
